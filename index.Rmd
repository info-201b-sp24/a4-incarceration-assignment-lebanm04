### Introduction

Introduction
Incarceration rates in the United States have been a topic of significant concern and study for decades. Understanding the dynamics of incarceration rates, particularly how they vary by race, gender, and geographic location, is crucial for informing policies and interventions aimed at reducing mass incarceration and addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system. This report analyzes various measures of incarceration using data on jail and prison population rates across different counties in Washington state from 1990 onwards. The primary variables of interest include total jail and prison population rates, disaggregated by race and gender.

Summary Information
This section summarizes key findings from the dataset. Below are five relevant summary statistics calculated from the data:

Average Total Jail Population Rate: The average total jail population rate across all counties and years is 194.94 per 100,000 people.
Maximum Total Jail Population Rate: The highest total jail population rate observed is 607.14 per 100,000 people.
Minimum Total Jail Population Rate: The lowest total jail population rate observed is 0 per 100,000 people.
Average Total Prison Population Rate: The average total prison population rate across all counties and years is 142.79 per 100,000 people.
Maximum Total Prison Population Rate: The highest total prison population rate observed is 388.92 per 100,000 people.
These statistics provide an overview of the incarceration rates in Washington state, highlighting the variation in jail and prison populations across different counties and over time.

The Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was collected by the Vera Institute of Justice, a non-profit organization focused on justice reform. The data was compiled from various sources, including government reports and correctional institution records, to provide a comprehensive view of incarceration rates over time. The primary purpose of collecting this data is to support research and advocacy efforts aimed at understanding and reducing mass incarceration.

Number of Observations: The dataset contains 308 observations (rows), representing different counties and years.
Number of Features: There are 23 features (columns) in the dataset, including variables such as county name, year, total population, jail and prison population rates disaggregated by race and gender, and urbanicity.
Ethical Considerations:
When working with incarceration data, it is important to consider the ethical implications, such as the potential for reinforcing racial stereotypes or biases. Additionally, the privacy and dignity of individuals represented in the data must be safeguarded. It is crucial to use the data responsibly, ensuring that analyses and conclusions drawn do not perpetuate injustice or discrimination.

Limitations:
One limitation of the dataset is the potential for missing or incomplete data, which can affect the accuracy of analyses. Additionally, the data may not capture all factors influencing incarceration rates, such as socio-economic conditions or changes in law enforcement practices. There may also be inconsistencies in how data was reported by different counties, which could impact the comparability of the results.

### Trends Over Time Chart

Include a chart. Make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

The first chart that you will create and include will show the trend over time of your variable/topic. Think carefully about what you want to communicate to your user (you may have to find relevant trends in the dataset first!). Here are some requirements to help guide your design:

- Show more than one, but fewer than ~10 trends
  - This may mean showing the same measure for different locations or different racial groups. Think carefully about a meaningful comparison of locations (e.g., the top 10 counties in a state, top 10 states, etc.)
- You must have clear x and y axis labels
- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
- You need a legend for your different line colors and a clear legend title

When we say "clear" or "human readable" titles and labels, that means that you should not just display the variable name.

Here's an example of how to run an R script inside an RMarkdown file:

``````{r, echo = FALSE, code = readLines("chart1_example.R")}
```

if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}
if (!requireNamespace("tidyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyr")
}


library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


data <- read.csv("us-prison-jail-rates-1990-WA.csv")


racial_groups <- c("aapi_jail_pop_rate", "black_jail_pop_rate", "latinx_jail_pop_rate", "native_jail_pop_rate", "white_jail_pop_rate")
data_long <- data %>%
  select(year, county_name, all_of(racial_groups)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = racial_groups, names_to = "Race", values_to = "Jail_Population_Rate")


ggplot(data_long, aes(x = year, y = Jail_Population_Rate, color = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Total Jail Population Rate by Year for Different Racial Groups in Washington State",
       x = "Year", y = "Jail Population Rate (per 100,000 people)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Racial Group")

### Variable Comparison Chart

Variable Comparison Chart
The second chart compares the total jail population rate with the total prison population rate across counties in Washington state. This comparison helps to explore the relationship between these two measures of incarceration.

Patterns Observed:

Correlation: There appears to be a positive correlation between jail and prison population rates, indicating that counties with higher jail rates tend to have higher prison rates as well.
Urbanicity: The chart also shows differences based on urbanicity, with urban and rural areas exhibiting distinct patterns in incarceration rates.

if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}


library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data <- read.csv("us-prison-jail-rates-1990-WA.csv")


latest_year_data <- data %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  ungroup()


ggplot(latest_year_data, aes(x = total_jail_pop_rate, y = total_prison_pop_rate, color = urbanicity)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Total Jail Population Rate vs Total Prison Population Rate by Urbanicity",
       x = "Total Jail Population Rate (per 100,000 people)", y = "Total Prison Population Rate (per 100,000 people)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Urbanicity")

### Map

Map
The map included in this report shows the geographic distribution of total jail population rates across different counties in Washington state. This visualization is essential for understanding how incarceration rates vary by location and can highlight regions with particularly high or low rates of incarceration.

Patterns Observed:

Spatial Variation: The map reveals significant spatial variation in jail population rates, with some counties exhibiting much higher rates than others.
Urban vs. Rural: Counties with higher jail population rates tend to be more rural, indicating potential differences in law enforcement practices or socio-economic factors.
Concentration of High Rates: Certain regions show a concentration of high incarceration rates, which could be indicative of localized issues that warrant further investigation.
